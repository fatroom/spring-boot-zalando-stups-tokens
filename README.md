## Tokens Support for Spring-Boot apps

Is a small wrapper around [Tokens](https://github.com/zalando-stups/tokens) with lifecycle-management and autoconfiguration-support in Spring-Boot applications.

With this in place you can use the 'AccessTokens' anywhere in your application (@Autowire directly or in a configuration class), use it directly or inject it into some 'TokenProvider'-implementations that delegate somehow.

### Install

#### Maven

Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.zalando.stups</groupId>
        <artifactId>tokens-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>${version}</version>
    </dependency>
```

#### Gradle

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```
compile('org.zalando.stups:tokens:${version}')
```

### Usage in Zalandos K8s environment (with `PlatformCredentialsSet`)

No need to configure anything. Only put the dependency into your pom.xml.
It uses `/meta/credentials` as a default folder to look for provided tokens by `PlatformCredentialsSet`.

Want to migrate from STUPS to K8s? [See the hints](#migration-from-zalandos-stups-env-to-zalandos-k8s-env).

### Usage in Zalandos STUPS environment

```
    tokens:
        accessTokenUri: http://localhost:9191/access_token?realm=whatever
    
        token-configuration-list:
            - tokenId: firstService
              scopes:
                  - read
                  - write
                  - all
            - tokenId: secondService
              scopes: all
```

### Migration from Zalandos STUPS env to Zalandos K8s env

Most common issue users do is not mounting the the credentials. Make sure you have something like this
in your `deployment.yaml`:

```
...
          volumeMounts:
          - name: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
            mountPath: /meta/credentials
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
          secret:
            secretName: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
```

Another issue would be that identifiers/names for tokens have to be same as before in your `credentials.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: "zalando.org/v1"
kind: PlatformCredentialsSet
metadata:
   name: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
spec:
   application: "{{ APPLICATION }}"
   tokens:
     firstService:
       privileges:
         - com.zalando::read
         - com.zalando::write
         - com.zalando::all
     secondService:
       privileges:
         - com.zalando::all
```

### Build

```
./mvnw install
```
