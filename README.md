## Tokens Support for Spring-Boot apps

Is a small wrapper around [Tokens](https://github.com/zalando-stups/tokens) with lifecycle-management and autoconfiguration-support in Spring-Boot applications.

With this in place you can use the 'AccessTokens' anywhere in your application (@Autowire directly or in a configuration class), use it directly or inject it into some 'TokenProvider'-implementations that delegate somehow.

### Install

#### Maven

Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.zalando.stups</groupId>
        <artifactId>tokens-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>${version}</version>
    </dependency>
```

#### Gradle

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```
compile('org.zalando.stups:tokens-spring-boot-starter:${version}')
```

### Usage in Zalandos K8s environment (with `PlatformCredentialsSet`)

Put the dependency into your pom.xml.
Declare CREDENTIALS_DIR environment variable pointing to your mount point (i.e. /meta/credentials).

Want to migrate from STUPS to K8s? [See the hints](#migration-from-zalandos-stups-env-to-zalandos-k8s-env).

### Usage in Zalandos STUPS environment

```
    tokens:
        accessTokenUri: http://localhost:9191/access_token?realm=whatever
    
        token-configuration-list:
            - tokenId: firstService
              scopes:
                  - read
                  - write
                  - all
            - tokenId: secondService
              scopes: all
```

### Migration from Zalandos STUPS env to Zalandos K8s env

Please make sure the credentials are mounted as shown in the example below.

```
...
          volumeMounts:
          - name: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
            mountPath: /meta/credentials
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
          secret:
            secretName: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
```

Please also make sure that token identifiers/names must equal the respective items in `credentials.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: "zalando.org/v1"
kind: PlatformCredentialsSet
metadata:
   name: "{{ APPLICATION }}-credentials"
spec:
   application: "{{ APPLICATION }}"
   tokens:
     firstService:
       privileges:
         - com.zalando::read
         - com.zalando::write
         - com.zalando::all
     secondService:
       privileges:
         - com.zalando::all
```

### Build

```
./mvnw install
```
